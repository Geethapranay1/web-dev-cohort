## What are serverless backends?
- Serverless backends are the backends that are managed by cloud providers.
- Serverless backends doesn't mean that there are no servers, it means that we don't have to manage the servers.
## problems with this approach
- Cold start: When we make a request to the serverless backend, it takes some time to start the server and then process the request. This time is called cold start time.
- More cost: Serverless backends are more costly than traditional servers.
